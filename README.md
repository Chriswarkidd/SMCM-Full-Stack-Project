Description: We have made a video game recommender website. It stores the games you save to your account. Once they are saved you can mark them as played. 
After they are marked as played, they can be rated on a scale of 1-5. This website has two algorithms. One to recommend a game randomly when no one is logged in. 
The other is a smart recommender that considers the games you've rated before and weighs the tags associated with that game and ranks games based on those tags. 
Users have the option to add games into our database to help populate it.
