Description: We created a Video Game recommender webapp. This webapp allows users to generate a single game recommendation, either based off of specific filters or by creating an account and using our customized recommendation system. Creating an account allows users to input any games that they have already played, along with a rating. The webapp will generate a result using our AI recommendation system according to the type of game and rating the user has provided. Without an account, users can simply select filters and generate a pseudo-random result.
